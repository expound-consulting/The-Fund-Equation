## Overview

*The Fund Equation* is an open, living playbook that demystifies VC incentives, fund lifecycles, and decision processes. It gives founders practical tools—checklists, templates, and “how to do the math” worksheets—to negotiate better, run tighter boards, and plan exits on your terms. Written by **Ken Cheney** and **Robert Gibson** (co-founders of **Expound Consulting**), the book combines real-world operating experience with current market context (post-ZIRP concentration, slower exits, more bridges/structured terms).

- **Who it’s for:** Founders (pre-seed → growth), operator-CEOs, CFOs, and curious VCs.
- **What you’ll learn:** LP→GP dynamics, reserve strategies, partner meetings, valuation mechanics (including 409A context), board control, investor communications, and exit timing economics.

---

## Quick Start

- **Raising Pre-Seed/Seed?** Start with **Chapter 1** (VC incentives) → **Chapter 4** (inside the partner meeting) → **Appendix H/G** (templates & calculators).
- **Series A–C?** Read **Ch. 2–3** (fund lifecycle & economics) and **Ch. 5–8** (ops, reporting, back-office implications), then **Ch. 14** (control stack).
- **Thinking about liquidity?** See **Ch. 13** (exit strategy) and **Ch. 3** (timing math & IRR).

## Notes

- This README summarizes a much larger manuscript; headings and examples map to sections in the document. The repo may include draft chapters, templates, and calculators as they’re production-readied.
- The project intentionally avoids prescriptive “one-size-fits-all” advice; it aims to give founders the context and tools to choose wisely for their situation.
